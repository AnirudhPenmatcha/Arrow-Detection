# Arrow-Detection
As part of my undergraduate university robotics's team -- RUDRA, I created a DL model that can detect pictures of arrows and in which direction they are pointing to. This repository contains all the files related to my project on detecting arrows using pre-trained neural networks. The weights are not included in the repo for competitive reasons. Lol.
