# Arrow-Detection
As part of my undergraduate university robotics's team -- RUDRA, I created a DL model that can detect pictures of arrows and in which direction they are pointing to. This repository contains all the files related to my project on detecting arrows using pre-trained neural networks. I used TensorFlow 2's Object Detection Module primarily but also tried and tested Yolo with the help of my teammate (had better inference speeds but can't remember why we didn't use it). I'm not going to lie this was a lot of pains taking work for me. I spent way more time on developing it than I should have as I didn't have any prior knowledge or expertise when I started this work. Literally created my own dataset by holding a printout of an arrow. Not once. Not twice. But thrice. Altough the detection didn't work as expected by the day of the competition, still got learn a ton by doing this project. Glad I got the opportunity to be a part

The weights are not included in the repo for competitive reasons. Lol.
